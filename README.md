# mini-games
A place for small games and tests!
Made using the awesome [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) framework

Install and get started with LÖVE [here!](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started) 

After installing Lua and LÖVE2D (11.3), run each using 'love game-folder'
* shipgame - Top down asteroids like game with levels and upgrades
* FlappyBird - A shameless flappy bird clone
* Bastion - Not far along angry birds style game with a focus on learning the box2d physics engine
* Online - A Test of the lua socket library for cooperative play on the same network (using the shipgame idea)
